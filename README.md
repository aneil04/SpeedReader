# SpeedReader

This is a web application that allows you to speed-read a paragraph of text. Simply run the html file, paste a body of text, choose your WPM speed, and read along!. Instead of scanning texts line by line, each word is displayed one after another. This way, you can read the text much faster without moving your eyes and still retain the information presented in the text!
